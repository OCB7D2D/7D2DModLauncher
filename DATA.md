# Some data I gathered during development

This is a loose compilation of some data I gathered
while developing this mod. Might be useful later.

## Battery MaxUseTimes and dis-/charge capacity

- Tier 1 => 5000 (29w)
- Tier 2 => 6000 (33w)
- Tier 3 => 7000 (37w)
- Tier 4 => 8000 (41w)
- Tier 5 => 9000 (45w)
- Tier 6 => 10000 (50w)

Batteries will alway be only charged at 5W.
But not sure if exchange is really even!?
