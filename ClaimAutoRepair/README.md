# OCB Claim Auto Repair Mod - 7 Days to Die (DMT/Harmony) Addon

A new block that will automatically repair damaged blocks within your claim.
Introduces a new block that is based on a storage chest. You need to put in
materials that are then used to repair random blocks within its vicinity.
The auto repair block has it's own (slightly increased) range, but will only
repair blocks that are within your or your allies claim (block the owner
could also pickup). So it's recommended to place the auto repair block
close to your actual claim block. Btw. they don't repair themselves.

The block will slowly and randomly try to pick blocks around its perimeter
and checks if it needs repair and if the required material are in the storage.
Once those prerequisites are met, the actual repair will start. Blocks are not
gradually repaired, but rather take time to fully restore the durability. If a
block that is being repaired is further damaged, the auto repair is aborted.
You should hear a sound from the box when it is repairing blocks and also if
a block in repair is further damaged (and repair in progress is aborted).

## Further improvements

It would be nice to have a better indication what the box is actually doing.
For now I only added some sounds, since that was pretty easy. Also a on and off
switch would be cool and finally I'm thinking about requiring power to drive it.
